Electronic mails, also known as emails, are a form of online communication where a user can send text, files, images or attachments over a network to a specific recipient or group. It is a very popular method of communication which makes it prone to various forms of misuse e.g. spam email. Spam emails refer to any unsolicited email sent in bulk to many random users. There are various forms of spam emails mainly ads, chain letters, email spoofs,hoaxes, money scams, malware warnings and porn spam. Some of these types have led to the spread of malware, phishing scams, social engineering exploits, spread of misinformation, fraud, etc. As a result, the need for ways to detect spam emails is needed in order to reduce the prevalence of the aforementioned exploits. Machine learning algorithms were introduced in order to create spam email filters. The paper aims to study some of the algorithms used and test their diagnostic abilities on detecting spam email.
