\subsection{Problem Statement}
Spam emails are used to send malware, initiate phishing scams, facilitating money scams, send unsolicited ads and spread false information. This has led to theft, fraud, black mailing through stealing user information from spywares and communications overload which eventually leads time wastage on manual deletion of the mails (\cite{kaspersky}).
