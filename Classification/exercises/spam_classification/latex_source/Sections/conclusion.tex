\section{Chapter 4: Conclusion}
The primary goal of the paper was to study the performance of some of the machine learning algorithms in spam email classification. The results showed that the machine learning algorithms especially the logistic regressor and random forest were highly capable of detecting spam emails thereby their use in creating spam filters will be highly effective. \\
For future works, I intend to study the more complex machine learning algorithms used in detecting spam emails and in turn attempt to create a similar complex algorithm that can be used for spam email classification and compare it to the studied algorithms.
