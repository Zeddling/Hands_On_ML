\subsubsection{Manual Detection of Spam Emails}
There are various methods used to detect phishing emails. The first method is by investigating the email. Some of the characteristics of the emails are (\cite{cisco_2019}):
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item The From: address does not align with the actual company's address.
    \item The presence of numerous spelling and grammatical errors as well as blurry and/or incorrect logos.
    \item Sense of urgency where the email dictates immediate action or captures your curiosity.
    \item The email requests for personal or sensitive information.
    \item The embedded URLs do not match those of the company's domain.
    \item The file types of the attachments are not those that are usually expected.
\end{enumerate}

However, people behave differently during the time of the attack thus the use of software to aid users in detecting such emails \cite{boag_2020}.
