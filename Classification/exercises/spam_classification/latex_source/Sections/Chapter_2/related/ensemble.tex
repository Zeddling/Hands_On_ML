\subsubsection{Spam Mail Classification Using Ensemble and Non-Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms}
The researchers aimed to explore ensemble machine learning algorithms and compare they're performance with non-ensemble algorithms (\cite{agarwal_uniyal_virendrasingh_krishna_dutt_2020}). They were able to achieve 98.47\% accuracy with the SVM which is a non-ensemble algorithm and the ensemble voting algorithm achieved a 96.80\% accuracy on the test dataset.  K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Naive Bayes and SVM were the the non-ensemble algorithms used. The different approaches used to create the ensemble classifiers were: Majority Voting where they took the best performing classifiers from each model and have them make a "vote" on each test instance making the final output prediction with the one with more than half the votes; Bootstrap Aggregating or Bagging where n models are created from one model and the same bootstrap sampling algorithm(Adaboost.SAMME) creates random n sub-samples drawn from the original dataset. Afterwards the n models are fitted to the n bootstrap samples which are then averaged by voting; Boosting approach trains each model with the same data set while adjusting the instance weights in relation to the error rate of the previous prediction (\cite{agarwal_uniyal_virendrasingh_krishna_dutt_2020}).
Below is a table showing the results obtained from the study.
